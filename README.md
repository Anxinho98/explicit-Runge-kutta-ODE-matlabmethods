# Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of **explicit Runge-Kutta methods** for numerically solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## What are explicit Runge-Kutta methods?

Explicit Runge-Kutta methods are numerical techniques used to approximate solutions to initial value problems in ODEs. They work by combining multiple evaluations of the derivative function to estimate the solution at the next step.  
The classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) is one of the most popular due to its balance of accuracy and efficiency.

## What are they used for?

These methods are applied in simulations and models where approximate solutions of ODEs are needed, such as in physics, biology, engineering, and finance.
